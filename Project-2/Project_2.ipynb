    "# Project 2: Implementing a Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will design, implement, and evaluate a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. This will involve building the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up TensorFlow or PyTorch environments. You are free to choose your preferred DL platform.\n",
    "2. Use GPU for training.\n",
    "3. Create a data loader and implement data preprocessing where needed.\n",
    "4. Design a Convolutional Neural Network.\n",
    "5. Train and evaluate your model. Make sure to clearly show loss and accuracy values. Include visualizations too.\n",
    "6. Answer assessment questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to choose any dataset for this project! Kaggle would be a good source to look for datasets. Below are some examples:\n",
    "- CIFAR-10: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes with 6,000 images per class.\n",
    "- MNIST: A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).\n",
    "- Fashion-MNIST: A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different clothing caregories.\n"

    "### Questions\n",
    "Answer the following questions in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)? Describe its key components and how they differ from those in a fully connected neural network.\n",
    "2. Explain the purpose of the convolution operation in a CNN. How does the use of different filter sizes affect the feature maps?\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of a pooling layer in a CNN, and how does it contribute to the networkâ€™s performance?\n",
    "4. Why are activation functions important in CNNs? Compare the use of ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) with other activation functions.\n",
    "5. Describe the process of training a CNN. What are some common challenges faced during training?\n",
    "6. What are some common evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a CNN on a classification task?\n",
    "7. How does data augmentation help improve the performance of a CNN? Provide examples of common data augmentation techniques.\n"
